  Abstract)](https://types2020.di.unito.it/abstracts/BookOfAbstractsTYPES2020.pdf) <br />
  The event was cancelled due to the corona virus crisis. There is, however, an
  [online forum](https://crew.i-learn.unito.it/course/view.php?id=45) where
  discussion can take place. You can get access by logging in using a Google
  account. My slides and a recording of my presentation are available there, and
  on this site:
