# Current job
I'm enjoying a prolonged summer holiday, but will start a new software engineering job at [Axini](https://www.axini.com/en/) in August.
Here, I will put my theoretical knowledge to practice in contributing to Axini's software for model-based testing.

# Past jobs
From November 2023 until June 2025,
I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences](https://h-ka.de) (DE) and the [University of Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/) (DE).
Together with [Peter Thiemann](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/) and Martin Sulzmann, I worked on the trace-based analysis of data races in concurrent programs.

From October 2019 until September 2023,
I did my PhD at the [Bernoulli
Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/), [University of
Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (NL) for the VIDI project [Unifying Correctness
for Communicating Software](https://www.jperez.nl/vidi) under the supervision of
[Jorge A. Pérez](https://www.jperez.nl/).
In April 2024 I successfully defended my dissertation, titled "Correctly Communicating Software: Distributed, Asynchronous, and Beyond" and available [here](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/correctly-communicating-software-distributed-asynchronous-and-bey).
My dissertation won the 2nd place [VERSEN](https://www.versen.nl/) 2024 PhD Thesis Award!

Before that,
I have been a Teaching Assistant for several courses taught by [Alban
Ponse](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.ponse/) and [Inge
Bethke](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/b/e/i.bethke/i.bethke.html) at the
[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) and the [Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/nl/index.aspx). Moreover, I have worked at [Het
Zwarte Fietsenplan](https://www.hetzwartefietsenplan.com/) for many years,
developing and maintaining their internal management website, as an employee and
more recently as a freelance developer.

# Studies
I have obtained my MSc in Logic at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/),
[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) (thesis under supervision of
[Jorge A. Pérez](https://www.jperez.nl/) and [Alban
Ponse](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.ponse/)) and my BSc in Computer Science at
the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/)
([thesis](https://esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f522241892.pdf) under
supervision of [Bob Diertens](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/b.diertens/) and [Alban
